## R_shiny_web_app
---

### What is this repository?
This repository has R files for web application developed by R shiny package.  

---

### Caution
R files are basically divided into ui.R and server.R,  
but it's quite difficult to read source codes.  
For this reason, a file in my repository includes not only ui.R but also server.R (e.g., my file name is ui_server.R).
